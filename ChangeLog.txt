BakingTray ChangeLog

Most commits and development should go in the dev branch (or a branch devoted to a specific feature).
When mature, changes should be merged into master *as a merge commit*  and this changelog file updated.

In the following text, the tag "USER" indicates a significant change that will impact user experience in some way. 
The tag "DEVELOPER" indicates a change that significantly impacts the code but is likely not visible to the user. 

24th April 2020
- DEVELOPER:
   * dummyScanner correctly saves tiles for stitching via BT.bake

23rd April 2020
- DEVELOPER:
   * downsampled tile size set using the number of microns per pixel rather than a fixed size in pixels.
   * previewScans and Bake largely work with the dummyScanner.
   * x/y speed set to default value on startup.
   * The update interval for the preview image can now be altered using a property. 
   * Add option to disable axis ready check during acquisition

21st April 2020
- DEVELOPER: 
   * dummyScanner uses previewStacks as dataset format.
   * dummyScanner has a basic UI: it can be started from the main BT menu and has a simple GUI with features available from menu.
   * Restructure acquisition_view into separate files

21st March 2019
- Tweaks to acquisition time estimate

17th January 2019
- USER: scan zoom factor automatically set in ScanImage. But can still be over-ridden afterwards if needed. 
- USER: resonant scanner remains on after preview scan to encourage it to settle. It will still be switched off at the end of the acquisition. 


8th January 2019
- USER: Add ability to send Slack messages. **YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM INI FILE**
- DEVELOPER: default front/left present in sys INI file but not implemented fully. **YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM INI FILE **
 Instructions:
 For the above, the easiest way is to move your system ini file to the back up settings dir. 
 Then run BakingTray.settings.readSystemSettings and manually add back your original settings 
 whilst editing the new values.
