BakingTray ChangeLog

Most commits and development should go in the dev branch (or a branch devoted to a specific feature).
When mature, changes should be merged into master *as a merge commit*  and this changelog file updated.

In the following text, the tag "USER" indicates a significant change that will impact user experience in some way.
The tag "DEVELOPER" indicates a change that significantly impacts the code but is likely not visible to the user.

For more information on major releases merged into master from pre-release.

  See `laser.m` properties for more information.

10th January 2025
- Selecting new sample now ensures the Save checkbox in ScanImage is not enabled. This fixes a rare user problem.


20th September 2024
- Some tweaks to MaiTai laser modelock check
- Minor bugfix affecting installs that are not done via Git


10th July 2024

- USER: Reset ScanImage on new sample

3rd June 2024
The following changes have been made over the last few months. There may be other minor changes too.
For information on adding new settings to the settings file(s) see: https://bakingtray.mouse.vision/getting-started/finishing-the-install/the-settings-files

- USER: Histogram windows close when acquisition saving is initiated.
- USER: remove "zoom" from the drop-down for resolution and convert "u" to Greek "mu".
- USER: add convenience buttons to raise sample and lower Z stage
- USER: close the new persistent histogram windows when tile saving is set up. likely this results in a small speedup.
- USER: Bake is not possible if sample ID or sample folder contain non-alphanumeric (- and _ are OK) The recipe class no longer corrects funny characters in file names.
- USER: A confirmation dialog pops up when the user tries to unlock the Z stage.
- USER: The error message that tells users to have the same PMTs on as channels saved is now worded more clearly.
- BUGFIX: fixed a bug that was causing voxel size to be incorrectly written now and then.
- BUGFIX: addLaserCalib fails gracefully if BakingTray is not started.
- POWERUSER: Update example settings files
- Minor bugfixes to acquisition resume
- Zaber class now works with Zaber X-LDA stages.


August 2022
- USER: Handle resume scenario where the acquisition has no completed sections.
- USER: Handle resume scenario where the autoROI.mat file is missing or corrupt.
- Minor bugfix to recipe saving: sometimes the wrong recipe settings were saved.
- Message telling user that the active PMTs and saved channels do match was confusing. It has been clarified.

7th November 2022
- USER (Dev -> Master) - Fix regression that had caused the laser power to no longer be displayed in the laser GUI.
- USER (Dev -> Master) - Add a tooltip to explain what the Lock-Z checkbox does.
- USER (Dev) - Overlay stage boundaries onto preview image.

August 2022
- USER (Dev) - Add routines that allow the user to display laser power in ScanImage. This will
         require the current (as of this date) ScanImage to work at all. To display power in mW
         in the BEAMS window, you will need to upgrade to the *next* release of ScanImage that is
         currently not available.
- USER (Dev) - Power at the sample is written to the acquisition log file.


26th July 2022
Various small bug fixes implemented over the last 7 months.
- USER (Dev) - Tested and made small fixes so BakingTray runs with SI 2021 and SI 2022.
- USER (Dev) - Running "BakingTray" at the command line will now start ScanImage first if necessary.


December 6th 2021
- USER (Dev) - Bugfix to ensure Front/Left is always viable.
- USER (Dev) - Do not display image box in Acq GUI axes if it's empty.
- USER (Dev) - Minor bugfix to AMS SIN11


11th October 2021
- DEVELOPER (Dev) - Pockels cell power can be automatically cut off using a DIO line that is controlled by laser GUI. This requires a relay that can handle mains voltage.


11th October 2021
- USER (Dev) - Do not write full recipe on Bake if one already exists (happens during a resume). This fixes a bug where the number
              of sections to acquire decreased each time an acquisition was resumed.
- POWERUSER (Dev) - Hidden feature to enable Pockels cell when laser is turned on or off. Uses an NI DAQ.
- USER (Dev) - Preview tile scan updates every other tile instead of every 10.
- USER (Dev) - Handle encoder with Faulhaber MCDC


22nd to 30th September
- USER (Dev) - Large re-organisation of acquire GUI to show a schematic of the slide. MAJOR.


22nd September 2021
- USER (Dev) - Cut size moved to Prepare GUI and is set automatically when "Set Blade Position" is pressed
- USER (Dev) - Z-jack now locks after the first slice not when a cutting position is set.
- USER (Dev) - Overlaid stage boundaries no longer are limited by the blade on the x axis.


21th September
- USER (Dev) - Auto-Trim now moves the sample to the correct side of the blade before starting if needed.


20th September
- USER (Dev) - Add support for ThorLabs Tiberius laser.


15th September
- USER (Dev) - Minor improvements to Z locking.


14th September
- USER (Dev) - Sample ID is set automatically after the user chooses a save directory
- DEVELOPER (Dev) - Stages are no longer checked for reference on each move. Other minor motion-related changes.


10th September 2021
- USER (Dev) - When a cutting position is set the Z jack motions via the GUI are disabled using a checkbox. This can be over-ridden by the user.
- USER (Dev) - Slice last section is now removed from the acqusition view and is disabled by default.


5th September 2021
- USER (Dev) - Stages that need referencing no longer auto-ref when connected. Instead the user must manually select Tools > References Stages from the menu.
- DEVELOPER (Dev) - Zaber linear stages can be used as X/Y. e.g. X-LRM100A-DE51 are verified to work.
- DEVELOPER (Dev) - Option to set a wait time that scales with distance moved during tile scan instead of waiting for stage to report motion completion. To use this, set fixedStageMotionTimeConstant in SIBT_settings.yml to a positive number or tweak hBT.scanner.settings.hardware.fixedStageMotionTimeConstant on an instance of a BT class. The latter will not be saved for future sessions. Zero means that BakingTray will wait for the motion controller to indicate it has completed a motion. 0.05 means BakingTray will wait 0.05 s per mm. So for a 2 mm motion there would be a 0.1 s wait. Note that there is an additional fixed delay on top of this due to ScanImage buffering time between frames. This is a fixed offset and is about 75 to 100 ms. So it could be that for, say, 1 mm motions little additional delay is really needed. This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature and may need further development. **So might be better off in general to initiate a non-blocking motion then wait at the end of the callback for the motion to complete.**

24th August 2021
- USER (Dev) - Cutting start point is set to NaN on startup and when a new sample created. System will not cut until it's set.
- USER (Dev) - Default sample name is now the microscope ID.
- USER (Dev) - Warning issued if the tile size in BakingTray does not match that in ScanImage.
- POWERUSER (Dev) - The new SYSTEM.defaultSavePath setting in the systemSettings.yml allows you to set the default path to which data should be saved. **It is suggested you set this!** It will reduce user errors and training time. <---

11th August 2021
- USER (Dev) - Add the ability move Z stage up and down with R and F in addition to Q and E.
6th August
Minor bug fixes and doc changes
- USER (Dev) - Compatibility bug fixes for SI Basic 2021.


1st July 2021
- USER (Dev) - Improve behavior of zoom buttons and box buttons in acq view. Includes bug fixes.
- USER (Dev) - The ROI that was last drawn by the user is painted temporarily onto the imaged area.

21st June 2021

18th June 2021
- USER (Dev) - If PMT Auto-On is enabled, the acquisition will not proceed.

17th June 2021
- USER (Dev) - Bugfix: Correct slow start on Bake
- USER (Dev) - New default settings in system settings file are now automatically added to the live file. A backup of the original live file is created.
- New option added to system settings file: defaultYcutPos. This allows the vibratime to be mounted off-centre
 with respect to objective. Useful for some water baths.
- USER (Dev) - Option to set dominant stage tiling direction. To date X was dominant. Now Y is default. NOTE: User should also update StitchIt!

4th May 2021
- USER - All trim slices now start from the cutting start point. This seems more like the expected behavior
- Bugfix - Attempt to trap error that is causing acquisition to crash if there is only one row or column of
           tiles near the the end of a sample. Acquisition will just end at this point. The assumption being
           that it is complete. This is not a perfect solution but it's serviceable for now.


3nd May 2021
- USER - If requested number of slices exceeds what is possible, the recipe is updated automatically. Therefore
          default recipe can now have a very large number of slices requested and by extension BakingTray will
          by default image the full available depth.
- USER - New Sample has a confirmation dialogue and resets settings in the prepare GUI.
- USER - Various bugfixes, including for SI Basic.

5th April 2021

- USER (dev): PMT auto-on is disabled each time the scanner is armed. i.e. each time a tile scan is done.
- USER (dev): Z-stage homes automatically when user goes to 0 mm from a position greater than 20 mm.
             NOTE: the above can be disabled by a new setting. Information on this is presented when
             the software starts. You will need to add SYSTEM.homeZjackOnZeroMove=0 to systemSettings.yml
             to disable the behavior or SYSTEM.homeZjackOnZeroMove=1 to disable warning message but retain
             the new behavior.

10th Feb 2021
- USER (dev): support report can now be generated from the Tools menu.

4th Feb 2021
- DEVELOPER - saved autoROI stats for logging now contain the image and binary mask used for each section.
- DEVELOPER - refactor of some autoROI code


20th Jan 2021

3rd December 2020
- User MAJOR CHANGES:
BakingTray now has an "Auto-ROI" feature. This is documented at https://bakingtray.mouse.vision.
You will need to make changes to settings files for this to work! These are described here:
- In MATLAB R2019b. Start with softwareOpenGl mode if you notice rare random crashes


** Install instructions for autoROI **
- MATLAB R2019b. Start with softwareOpenGl mode if you notice rare random crashes
- In your default recipe which is to be loaded each time ensure you have "numOverlapZPlanes: 0.0" in the mosaic section
- You will likely to have to play with the fields in SIBT.setings.tileAcq until the preview image looks correct.
  Make the changes permanent by editing the appropriate file in the SETTINGS directory.
- Update stitchit ini file. IMPORTANT: this includes the stitched image UD and LR flips. Ensure the final stitched images
  aren't flipped compared to BakingTray!
- In StitchIt the TissueCyte settings are now gone from the StitchIt ini files. You should remove the [experiment], [micsPerPixel], and "Objectives" sections. See the stitchitConf_DEFAULT.ini file in StitchIt for an example.
https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/StitchIt/blob/master/code/INI/stitchitConf_DEFAULT.ini
