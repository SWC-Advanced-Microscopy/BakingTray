Release 22nd September 2022

This release encapsulates changes made between 22nd September 2022 and February 2022.
The last major release was 7th December 2021.


Some small bug fixes are included:
- The system no longer hangs in scanning mode if the brain has vanished during AutoROI. This sometimes happened and stopped a clean shutdown of Baking.

- PMT trip reset works in newer SI versions.

- A bug fix associated with the default Y position being wrong under certain situations.

Two fixes/improvements to resuming of acquisitions
 - A bugfix when creating the backup recipes during resume.
 - BakingTray will no longer write into a directory marked as FINISHED

- The code that handles Pockels power supply being switched on with the laser is now working properly.



NEW FEATURES
- There is a function called "assessAverage" that you can run when you are over the brain during set up.
It will take 16 frames and show you what they look like at different levels of averaging. The idea is
that you run this before you have scanned the area and do so at the laser power you will end up using.
This is a more effective way of estimating how much you might want to average, as dwelling over an
area in Focus mode will *rapidly bleaach the sample* and so cause you to over-estimate how effective
averaging is.

- Running "BakingTray" at the command line will now start ScanImage if it is not already started.

- You can now display laser power in mW in ScanImage and have it automatically update when the wavelength is changed. The feature has been tested only with ScanImage 2022 but hopefully will work in some earlier versions also.

To use it:
 1. Open the Laser GUI in BakingTray.
 2. Turn on the laser and open the shutter.
 3. Set desired wavelength in the laser GUI.
 4. In ScanImage run the beam calibration function from the beams widget. You will need a photodiode
    in the path. If you do not have this, you can use the power meter at the objective so long as the
    sensor is fast enough. Connect the AO from the sensor to an AI line on the DAQ. In the machine
    config file where the beam is configured, tell ScanImage which AI line to look at. You should get
    a nice smooth curve with the calibration tool.
 5. Measure min and max power and set these in the MDF GUI under the laser. You can access this
    from the gear icon on the beams widget.
 6. Confirm with power meter that the curve makes sense by looking at a few different values. It is
    normal to be off by about 10% and for low values (e.g. 10 mW) to be off by 50%. For the values
    typically used for imaging, however, it should be accurate enough.
 7. Run BakingTray.utils.addLaserCalib. This will store the information in a .MAT file and over-write
    any existing calibration at the same wavelengths, should this exist.
 8. Run this for your commonly used wavelengths. e.g. 920 nm, 800 nm, 780 nm. When you change
    wavelength, BakingTray will look for the closest calibration file. e.g. if you go to did the above three calibrations and you go to 930 nm, it will load the 920 nm calibration. If the laser wavelength
    is more than 20 nm from any existing calibration file, then it will not report laser power at all.

You may list existing calibrations with BakingTray.utils.listLaserCalib
