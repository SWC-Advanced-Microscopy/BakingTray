Data format:
Col 1 - wavelength
Col 2 - the two photon absorption spectrum (aka 2PA cross section)
Col 3 - the two-photon brightness (aka action cross section)


NOTE:
Currently we do not have excitation for spectra for some flurophores. To approximate them temporarily we use other spectra with roughly similar spectra. 
So we approximate Alexa647, for instance, with eBFP because this will give the 
same answer for optimal wavelength. The "fake" spectra and their sources are:

Af647 - eBFP
eYFP - eCFP
DiO - eGFP
DII - eCFP
