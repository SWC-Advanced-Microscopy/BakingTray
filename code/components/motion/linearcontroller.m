classdef (Abstract) linearcontroller < handle & loghandler
%%  linearcontroller 
%
% The linearcontroller abstract class is a software entity that represents the 
% physical linear stage controller object. 
%
% The linearcontroller abstract class declares methods that are used by the BakingTray class
% to move linear actuators, linear stages, PIFOCs, etc. A small number of methods are
% defined within this abstract class. Most methods are defined in concrete classes
% that must inherit linearcontroller. Examples of these include C891 and BSC201. 
%
% Classes that inherit linearcontroller serve as a "glue" or "bridge" between the 
% hardware manufacturer's API and BakingTray. These classes provide a consistent
% interface, so that any hardware can be used with the BakingTray class.
%
%
% NOTE!
% When setting up your system, always ensure that it is not possible for hardware to 
% move to a position that might cause damage. Use the minPos and maxPos properties 
% of linearstage to define soft limits that methods moving the stage will respect. 
% Use a safe environment to ensure these are respected before deploying any new classes
% or significant changes to the code. You might also want to set up limit switches or, 
% better yet, position the hardware such that it is not possible for collisions to 
% occur.

    properties

        hC  %A handle to the hardware controller object. e.g. this could be a serial port
            %or another object that actually sends out the commands over serial, USB, or whatever.

        attachedStage % The stage attached to the controller:
                    % myLinearControllerObject.attachedStage = myLinearStageObject
                    % Systems with multiple stages in one physical controller should
                    % have multiple copies of the controller object, each with a different
                    % stage attached. This system isn't tested yet, as no such hardware
                    % is available to us. 

        controllerID % The information required by the method that connects to the 
                     % the controller at connect-time. This can be specified in whatever
                     % way is most suitable for the hardware at hand. e.g. see how this is
                     % used in genericPIcontroller. This property may not be needed. 

        maxStages   % A scalar indicating what is the maximum number of stages a controller 
                    % can handle.
