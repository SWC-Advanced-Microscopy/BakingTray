function runSuccess = runTileScan(obj)
    % This method initiates the acquisition of a tile scan for one section
    %
    % function runSuccess = BT.runTileScan(obj)
    %
    % Purpose
    % The method moves the sample to the front/left position, initialises some variables
    % then initiates the scan cycle. This method is called by BT.bake and runs on whatever
    % is in currentTilePattern. If currentTilePattern is empty, it is populated.
    %
    % Outputs
    % runSuccess - returns a structure describing if the command succeeded and if it failed why.
    %              runSuccess.success = true or false
    %              runSuccess.msg = '' a string that returns reason for failure if so.
    %              This latter is done because failure to find a preview stack indicates that
    %              likely there is not much tissue left to image and we can almost certainly
    %              bail out.

        if isempty(pos)
            return
        end
    end

    % Bail out if the preview image data could not be made. When this happens
    % it generally indicates that the auto-ROI has reached the end of the sample.

    % Concept
    % We can't run the tile scan in an explicit for loop because we need to trigger the next frame
    % *immediately* after the acquisition of the current frame. So this needs to be an event
    % triggered by a listener that's monitoring the notifier which fires when the frame has been
    % acquired. So the events that handle the next frame will be triggered by the callback function
    % we attach to frameAcquired in ScanImage. We just have to initiate the first frame here, then
    % the acquisition process will continue until all frames have been acquired.

    startTime=now;

    % Instruct the scanner to initiate the tile scan. This may simply involving issuing a trigger if tile scanning
    obj.scanner.initiateTileScan; %acquires a stack and triggers the scanner (e.g. ScanImage) to acquire the rest of the stacks
