    % Determine which ROIs to image in the subsequent physical section.
    %
    % function success = BT.getNextROIs(obj)
    %
    % Purpose
    % This method sets the bounding boxes for the *next* physical section. To achieve this
    % it first runs BT.returnPreviewStructure, which provides a structure containing the 
    % current preview image plus other relevant information. This is fed into a function
    % called "autoROI". Also fed into this function is a "stats" structure that contains 
    % information on where the ROIs are. This is somewhat confusing and works as follows:
    %
    % 1) User runs a preview scan, where the whole FOV is imaged. From this ROIs are selected. 
    %    These ROIs are stored in BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats, as described above. At this
    %    point BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats has a length of 1. 
    % 2) We enter BT.bake and image section 1 using the ROIs from the preview.
    % 3) After we have imaged the ROIs this method is run. It pulls in the ROI image using
    %    the method BT.returnPreviewStructure
    % 4) autoROI is run using this image and the ROIs used to image section 1. This mean that 
    %    the autoROI function must chop up the large preview image into the defined ROIs and
    %    analyse each in turn to decide what will happen to this imaged area (smaller, bigger,
    %    translate it).
    % 5) autoROI returns an output such that BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats now has a length of 2.
    %    The second (final) element contains the ROIs for section 2. We image section 2 then 
    %    go back to step 3, above. We keep looping until all brain is imaged or max number of
    %    sections reached. 
    %
    % There is one non-obvious detail that is important. Consider these two points:
    % i) The ROIs calculated from section n are not used image section n, but section n+1.
    %    In other words, the ROIs in BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats(n) were *calculated* using 
    %    section n-1. 
    % ii) The stage front/left position of the section image will almost certainly change
    %     from section to section. 
    % BUT we feed into autoROI the current section image, n, and the ROIs used to image it.
    % However, those ROIs were obtained from image n-1. Thus, the current section image
    % and the ROIs in index n do not share the same front/left position and so we can't 
    % just feed them into autoROI. 
    %
    % Thus, after we have extracted the pStack from section n (step 3, above) we also must 
    % shift the ROIs in BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats(n), as these were extracted from section
    % n-1. Once we have done this, the image extract from section n and the ROIs at index
    % in BT.autoROI.stats.roiStats(n) will overlay each other **even though** the ROIs were
    % extracted from section n-1. 
    %
    %
    % Inputs
    % None -- extracts info from class
    %
    % Outputs
    % success -- true if ROIs were found. false otherwise. For example, this class would
    %            return false if the sample vanished from one section to the next. Reasons
    %            why the sample would vanish include the user accidently switching off the 
    %            PMTs, the agar block detaching from the slide to which it is glued, etc.
